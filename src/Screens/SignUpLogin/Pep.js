              A Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is an individual who holds a prominent public position or function in a government body
              or an international organisation in Australia or overseas,
              such as a Head of State, or Head of a Country or Government, or a Government Minister, or equivalent senior politician.
              A PEP can also be an immediate family member of a person referred to above, including spouse, de facto partner, child, and a childâ€™s spouse or a parent.
              A close associate of a PEP,
              i.e. any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal arrangement or entity is also considered to be a PEP.
              Where you identify as, or have an association with, a PEP, we may request additional information from you.
